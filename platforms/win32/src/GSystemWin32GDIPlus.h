/** Win32 implementation of the graphic system used for manipulating 
	platform independant drawing devices and fonts. 

	A VGSystem object (for Virtual Guido drawing System) is the highest
	graphical abstraction whose child-object can be used by a client app 
	to obtain a platform dependant graphical system able to perform guido 
	drawing or printing operations (like double-buffered display on the 
	current screen or printing). To do so, the client app simply needs to
	intantiate an object of the appropriate platform dependant VGSystem 
	derived class using the correct platform dependant parameters.

	A VGSystem object deals mainly with two kinds of graphical objects:

		- VGDevice objects, which can be display devices, memory devices
		or printer devices;
		- VGFont objects, used to describe device independant fonts (for
		music or text).

	Using VGSystem in the ScoreProcessingLib:

	VGSystem is the only object the client app should be able to manipulate 
	in order to use any graphical capability of the ScoreProcessingLib (ie 
	displaying, offscreen drawing and printing).

	To do so, the client should instantiate a VGSystem child-class object 
	with every platform dependant data and tell the ScoreProcessingLib to 
	use it. The VGSystem child-class instance is then responsible for 
	allocating the necessary VGDevices and VGFont.
